        <h2>MADRID</h2>
        <p>
          Madrid is the capital of Spain with elegant boulevards and large parks
          very well cared for, such as the Buen Retiro. It is famous for its
          rich collections of European and Spanish art in the Prado Museum. The
          heart of the old Habsburg Madrid is the Plaza Mayor lined with
          porticoes and close by is the Royal Palace and the Armory, which
          exhibit historic arsenals.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Madrid lies on the River Manzanares in the centre of both the
          country and the Community of Madrid is bordered by the autonomous
          communities of Castile and León and Castile-La Mancha.

        <h2>LONDON</h2>
        <p>
          London is the capital and largest city of England and the United
          Kingdom. Standing on the River Thames in the south-east of England, at
          the head of its 50-mile (80 km) estuary leading to the North Sea,
          London has been a major settlement for two millennia. Londinium was
          founded by the Romans.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          The City of London, London's ancient core − an area of just 1.12
            square miles (2.9 km2) and colloquially known as the Square Mile −
            retains boundaries that follow closely its medieval limits.
